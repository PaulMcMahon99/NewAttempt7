This shop section is disabled as the DB fails to work correctly.
It should operate exactly like the official example, but when
combined with the registration handling aspect of the DB fails
to operate for a reason that could not be found.

It remains disabled as this problem could not be resolved.  Should the
issue be corrected, the entire website will be functional.

This website was originally intended to allow Google logins, but the attempt
to fix this issue took all the available development time and prevented
the extra functionality from being coded in.
